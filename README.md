Parrot Refactoring Kata
=======================

Can you spot any code smells in this code? I'll give you a clue - a spot of Pol(l)ymorphism should improve matters!

Refactor this code, take small steps, run the tests often. See how small and beautiful and polymorphic you can make it.

I made a [video explaining this kata](https://youtu.be/UxNEHKg_2eA), and videos with worked solutions:

* [in C#](https://youtu.be/IvFX8Ivit1k)
* [in Java](https://youtu.be/7IT6c8wwHs4)
* [in Python](https://youtu.be/pO_5DQ3vDtc)

There is also a Guided Learning Hour using this exercise: [Everyday Design Improvements in OO Code](https://youtu.be/NCEWAqEFPic)

Acknowlegements
---------------

This code is heavily inspired by one of the examples in Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring". It's a classic, and if it's not on your bookshelf already I suggest you treat yourself to a copy!
